We are going to write a system tray application for Twitch viewers, in Go.

# Requirements

## Login

The user needs to log into their twitch account, so we can see who they follow. 

## Status
Clicking on the system tray icon shows the current state of your follows on Twitch:
- Which streamers you follow are live, what they are playing, and how many are watching, how long they've been streaming
- The top 5 streamers in the categories you follow, how many are watching, how long they've been streaming
- Which streamers you follow are scheduled to start in the next 24hrs

## Actions

- Clicking on a live streamer opens their twitch channel in the default browser

## Notifications

- A system notification is sent when someone you follow goes live
- a system notification is sent when someone you follow changes categories

## Nonfunctional Requirements

Write this in golang. Write idiomatic golang. Only write comments when code breaks the principle of least surprise. Write your own CLAUDE.md based on what you build and these instructions.

The system tray icon should be cross platform: windows mac and Linux. 

Configuration (eg the twitch auth token) should be stored in the idiomatic way for the operating system.

If the Twitch api doesn't support some kind of live notification that works client side (eg holding a port open, not webhooks), poll every minute.
